        <h2>A Taste of Greece</h2>
        <p>Greek cuisine (Greek: Ελληνική Κουζίνα) is the cuisine of Greece and the Greek diaspora.
            In common with many other cuisines of the Mediterranean, it is founded on the triad of wheat, olive oil, and wine.
            It uses vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, and meat, including pork, poultry, veal and beef, lamb, rabbit, and goat.
            Other important ingredients include pasta (for example hilopites), cheeses, lemon juice, herbs, olives, and yogurt.
            Bread made of wheat is ubiquitous; other grains, notably barley, are also used, especially for paximathia.
            Common dessert ingredients include nuts, honey, fruits, and filo pastries.
            It continues traditions from Ancient Greek and Byzantine cuisine, while incorporating Balkan and Italian influences.</p>
