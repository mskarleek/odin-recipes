                <ul>
                    <li>5.75 cups (800 g) bread flour</li>
                    <li>2cups+2tbsp (500 ml) water</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>0.25 oz (7 g) dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1.5 tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>1.5 tbsp table salt</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="h2">Directions</div></div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the lukewarm water into a bowl, then add and dissolve the dry yeast along with the sugar. Now, add half of the flour amount into the bowl, stirring, then add the salt and the extra-virgin olive oil. Continue to add flour stirring until the mixture becomes dense enough to be worked on a wooden board.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough adding more flour if necessary, at least 10 minutes more until the Pita mixture becomes smooth and elastic. Finally, let the dough rest on the board, covered with a dampened kitchen towel a couple of hours, until double its size.</li>
                    <li>Divide the Pita dough into 16 to 24 portions, depending on the size of Pita you desire, and shape them into balls. Then, cover again the balls with the kitchen towel until they double their size.</li>
                    <li>A cast iron skillet is the best choice to cook Greek Pita. Place the skillet over medium heat and grease the bottom with a thin layer of extra-virgin olive oil. After that, pour a little amount of flour on a board and shape the first dough ball into a circle ¼ thick, letting the other balls covered.</li>
                    <li>Now, place the Pita on the hot skillet and cook about 1 minute per side.</li>
                </ol>
